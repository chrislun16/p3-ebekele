The goal of this pen test was to test the security of SDSC. We wanted to see how easy it is to break into SDSC’s server.In this pen test, we wrote a python program to generate all possible passwords for SDSC’s wifi given all the different combinations of the. We then used aircrack on our VM to find which password is the one we need to get into SDSC’s wifi. We then accessed SDSC’s wifi. Our findings were that SDSC's wifi is not secure. For example I was able to get into SDSC's wifi network quickly.One area in which SDSC can improve is using a longer password. If they use a longer password then it will take more time for the python script to generate all possible passwords and for aircrack to find the right password and that will deter hackers.Findings:Wifi password: EECS388-8jw
